# TODO

### High Priority

- ~~Add `where` or `when` to prompts so questions can be asked programmatically~~

- ~~Ensure cleanup on failure~~

- Logging

- JSON schemas for prompts and config

### Medium Priority

- Add some default variables that can be accessed in all templates (source and destination directories, for example)

- ~~Add ability to use a git url instead of a directory~~

- Fix `when` infinite looping if Id doesn't exist


### Low priority

- Git submodule for composability support

- Add a choice option field

- Stubble options for throwing on missing keys (e.g throw on missing keys in config, but don't throw for missing keys in file)
